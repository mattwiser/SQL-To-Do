# Quantified To-Do

## Elevator Pitch

I'm a data junkie. There are apps to analyze your sleeping habits, watching habits, and a myriad of other metrics. I want to create a to do application that can tell me interesting statistics about my tasks over time. How often do I log activity? How often do I complete a task? What's the averagw time it takes me to complete a task?

## Project Requirements

  * A Simple feature set
  * Create, Read, Update, Delete Tables
  * Intermediate SQL Queries

## Feature List:

   * I can enter information and save it as a Task: Low/Med/High Priority, Start Date, Due Date, Notes, and Category
   * I can query for my avergae, minimum, and maximum time to complete a task.
   * I can look a list of tasks by day, week, and month.
   * I can get a report of my most and least used Task Categories, and how often I complete a task.

## Interesting Query:

Figuring out average time to complete tasks.
